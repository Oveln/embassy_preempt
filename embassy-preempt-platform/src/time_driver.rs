    /// past.  This is can be detected by double-checking that the alarm is still in the future after enabling it; if it isn't, `false`
    /// should also be returned to indicate that the callback may have been called already by the alarm, but it is not guaranteed, so the
    /// caller should also call the callback, just like in the more common `false` case. (Note: This requires idempotency of the callback.)
